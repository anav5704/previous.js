This is a simple landing page I made for `previous.js`, which isn't a real thing. The main idea was to attempt to make a modern and clean website, similar to modern web frameworks and products. The aesthetic is heavily inspired by the `next.js` website - black, white and Geist sans. This project is a NX monorepo and all the components are in the `libs/shared/ui` folder. This has no main purpose - I was just trying it out.

## Technologies Used

-   Next JS 14
-   TailwindCSS
-   NX monorepo

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run `npm install` to download all the dependencies. Once that is done, run `npx nx run web:dev` to view it on localhost.
